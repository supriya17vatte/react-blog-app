          Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
           "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also 
           to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, 
           part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity 
           is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
